# ClipboardFileTransfer

__ClipboardFileTransfer__ is a small utility for Windows and Linux that __transfers files using the clipboard__. 

For example, have you ever been connected to a remote system via VNC, with shared clipboard but no way of transfering files? Just run ClipboardFileTransfer both in the host and the remote server and you will be able to transfer files between the two systems.
